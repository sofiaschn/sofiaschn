Hi! I'm a full-stack software developer based in Brazil. Just like my website layout, I prefer to keep my code and profile minimal and efficient.

### What I work with
* **Primary Focus:** C and C++
* **Web:** JavaScript, TypeScript, and PHP
* **Open Source:** I occasionally contribute to open-source projects (including exactly [*one* whole commit to the Linux Kernel](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=5ede90206273ff156a778254f0f972a55e973c89), but hey, it counts!).
